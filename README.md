# weekly demos
i'm kinda rushing this because there are less than 3 hours left in this week, i'll rewrite this next week


basically the idea is that every week i need to code up a demo. for the purposes of this, a demo is any visual/audio effect. there are no rules outside of that, i can use any platform, any tools, whatever

## how 2 run
to run x86 demos:
`make 000.com && make 000.com && flatpak run com.dosbox.DOSBox 000.com`
